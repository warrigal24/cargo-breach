# Cargo Breach

By Garry Francis

## Background

You wake suddenly. When you look out the porthole, you see that it's dark outside. It should be light. You must have overslept. Why didn't anyone wake you? Maybe they felt sorry for you after you got seasick during yesterday's storm.

As you rub the sleep from your eyes and glance around the cramped crew's quarters, you realise that you're alone. Where are the guys from the day shift? Why aren't they in bed? You jump out of your bunk and quickly get dressed. You then realise that everything is quiet. Too quiet. There's not even the familiar rumble of the ship's steam engine, only the rhythmic beat of the ocean waves against the hull.

Something is wrong. But what?

This is a traditional text adventure that was written for [PunyJam #4](https://itch.io/jam/punyjam-4), 17 November to 17 December 2023. The game is hosted at [Cargo Breach](https://warrigal.itch.io/cargo-breach).
