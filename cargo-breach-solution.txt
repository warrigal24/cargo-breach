This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These can be omitted once you know what to do.

Note that nautical directions are used throughout: A = Aft, F = Fore, P = Port, S = Starboard.
